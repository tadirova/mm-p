    'Despite the uncertainty of the future, I‚Äôm certain about one thing: I want to use technology to connect people and make a difference, even if it‚Äôs just for one person. My path into software engineering began with a love for music, which evolved into a fascination with the patterns shared by both sound and code. Starting with C++ and algorithmic thinking, my interests expanded to Quantum Computing, especially its creative potential. This led to my thesis on Quantum Computer Music, where I explored tools like Max for Live, Qutune, Qiskit, and Python. I believe that blending music and computing can unlock new ways of approaching both human and technical challenges.';

   I am constantly amazed by the beauty and complexity of the world around me, and creating art allows me to capture that beauty and share it with others.
    For me, there is nothing more rewarding than creating something that brings joy and inspiration to me and everyone around me.
The process of creating something from nothing, using only my imagination and the tools ar hand is deeply satisfying and peaceful.

The first time I saw a grand piano in real life, I knew it would become a significant part of me. Soon after,
 I began piano lessons and music theory, which opened up a new way of perceiving the world, even everyday sounds. 
 A simple knock on the door suddenly had a different dimension. I started composing at nine, and performing in 
 competitions helped me overcome one of my greatest fears: being alone on stage. Later, I joined projects working with
  people with disabilities, drawing on my Erasmus+ experience in Portugal where I explored how they engage with sound and art. 
  This year, my path shifted as I began DJing. Electronic music and club culture have always fascinated me the shared experiences, 
  the sense of connection. Since then, I‚Äôve played gigs in over five cities, 
  developing new technical skills and seeing music from a fresh perspective.

  I‚Äôve been dancing for about 14 years, and I‚Äôm still a proud member of the same dance team, ‚ÄúGazeli,‚Äù that I joined at the beginning of my journey. Through dance, I discovered how to hold myself on stage and build genuine confidence.
This art form has brought me lifelong friendships and unforgettable experiences. With my team, I‚Äôve had the chance to travel and compete in places like Italy, Turkey, and Serbia, as well as in numerous competitions at home.
These travels expanded my horizons, introducing me to diverse cultures, traditions, and landmarks. Dance has given me a profound sense of freedom and proven that when you pursue what you love, the rewards are limitless.
